    <h2>The world’s most beloved noodle dish</h2>

    <p>Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour sauce scattered with crushed peanuts.
         It’s made with thin, flat rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, scrambled egg,
          firm tofu and a protein – the most popular being chicken or prawns/shrimp.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tbsp tamarind puree , NOT concentrate</li>
        <li>tbsp (packed) brown sugar</li>
        <li>tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.
        </li>
        <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Stir Fry:: Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.
        </li>
        <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.
        </li>
        <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.
        </li>
    </ol>
